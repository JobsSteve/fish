Setup:
To start using this project you'll need to edit your input in the project settings.  Raptor Combat uses some of the default input settings but you'll need to add a few.  

Add the following to your input list:
- "Slow Motion" - Suggestion: mouse 0
- "Pause" - Suggestion: ESC

Additionally you may want to adjust the input buttons for "Fire1" and "Fire2".  Fire1 is the input for shooting bullets (suggestion: space) while Fire2 is for homing missiles (suggestion: left shift).
